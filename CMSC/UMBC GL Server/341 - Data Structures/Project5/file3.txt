       Your program will read a text file and compress it using your implementation of 
the Huffman coding algorithm found in the explanation. The compressed text will be

     Your program will read a text file and compress it using your implementation of 
the Huffman coding algorithm found in the explanation. The compressed text will be 
written to a file. That compressed file will be then be read back by your program and
 uncompressed. The uncompressed text will then be written to a third file. The
  uncompressed text file should of course match the original text file character for
   charcter Assuming you can write a specific number of bits at a time to a file, a
    compressed file is made using the following top-level steps. These steps will be

    step for now and assume that all character weights have been calculated. Huffman's
     algorithm assumes that we're building a single tree from a group (or forest) of 
     trees. Initially, all the trees have a single node with a character and the character's
      weight. Trees are combined by picking two trees, and making a new tree from the 
      two trees. This decreases the number of trees by one at each step since two trees
       are combined into one tree. The algorithm is as follows:
       Your program will read a text file and compress it using your implementation of 
the Huffman coding algorithm found in the explanation. The compressed text will be 
written to a file. That compressed file will be then be read back by your program and
 uncompressed. The uncompressed text will then be written to a third file. The
  uncompressed text file should of course match the original text file character for
   charcter Assuming you can write a specific number of bits at a time to a file, a
    compressed file is made using the following top-level steps. These steps will be 
    developed further into sub-steps, and you'll eventually implement a program based 
    on these ideas and sub-steps. There are two parts to an implementation: a

    to have a useful compression utility. We'll assume these are separate programs,

     Your program will read a text file and compress it using your implementation of 
the Huffman coding algorithm found in the explanation. The compressed text will be 
written to a file. That compressed file will be then be read back by your program and
 uncompressed. The uncompressed text will then be written to a third file. The
  uncompressed text file should of course match the original text file character for
   charcter Assuming you can write a specific number of bits at a time to a file, a
    compressed file is made using the following top-level steps. These steps will be

We'll assume that each character has an associated weight equal to the number of times
 the character occurs in a file. In the "go go gophers" example, the characters 'g' and

   When compressing a file we'll need to calculate these weights, we'll ignore this

      weight. Trees are combined by picking two trees, and making a new tree from the 
      two trees. This decreases the number of trees by one at each step since two trees

    compressed file is made using the following top-level steps. These steps will be 
    developed further into sub-steps, and you'll eventually implement a program based 
    on these ideas and sub-steps. There are two parts to an implementation: a 
    compression program and an uncompression/decompression program. You need both 
    to have a useful compression utility. We'll assume these are separate programs,

We'll assume that each character has an associated weight equal to the number of times
 the character occurs in a file. In the "go go gophers" example, the characters 'g' and
  'o' have weight 3, the space has weight 2, and the other characters have weight 1.
   When compressing a file we'll need to calculate these weights, we'll ignore this
    step for now and assume that all character weights have been calculated. Huffman's
     algorithm assumes that we're building a single tree from a group (or forest) of 
     trees. Initially, all the trees have a single node with a character and the character's
      weight. Trees are combined by picking two trees, and making a new tree from the 
  two trees. This decreases the number of trees by one at each step since two trees
   are combined into one tree. The algorithm is as follows:

     algorithm assumes that we're building a single tree from a group (or forest) of 
     trees. Initially, all the trees have a single node with a character and the character's
      weight. Trees are combined by picking two trees, and making a new tree from the 
      two trees. This decreases the number of trees by one at each step since two trees
       are combined into one tree. The algorithm is as follows:
       Your program will read a text file and compress it using your implementation of 
the Huffman coding algorithm found in the explanation. The compressed text will be 
written to a file. That compressed file will be then be read back by your program and
 uncompressed. The uncompressed text will then be written to a third file. The
  uncompressed text file should of course match the original text file character for
   charcter Assuming you can write a specific number of bits at a time to a file, a
    compressed file is made using the following top-level steps. These steps will be 
    developed further into sub-steps, and you'll eventually implement a program based 
    on these ideas and sub-steps. There are two parts to an implementation: a 
    compression program and an uncompression/decompression program. You need both 
    to have a useful compression utility. We'll assume these are separate programs,
     but they share many classes, functions, modules, code or whatever unit-of-
     programming you're using. We'll call the program that reads a regular file and

The minimal trees have weights of three and four, these are joined into a tree whose weight 
is seven leaving two trees. 
We'll assume that each character has an associated weight equal to the number of times
 the character occurs in a file. In the "go go gophers" example, the characters 'g' and
  'o' have weight 3, the space has weight 2, and the other characters have weight 1.
   When compressing a file we'll need to calculate these weights, we'll ignore this
    step for now and assume that all character weights have been calculated. Huffman's
     algorithm assumes that we're building a single tree from a group (or forest) of 
     trees. Initially, all the trees have a single node with a character and the character's
      weight. Trees are combined by picking two trees, and making a new tree from the 
      two trees. This decreases the number of trees by one at each step since two trees
       are combined into one tree. The algorithm is as follows:
       Your program will read a text file and compress it using your implementation of 
the Huffman coding algorithm found in the explanation. The compressed text will be 
written to a file. That compressed file will be then be read back by your program and
 uncompressed. The uncompressed text will then be written to a third file. The
  uncompressed text file should of course match the original text file character for
   charcter Assuming you can write a specific number of bits at a time to a file, a
    compressed file is made using the following top-level steps. These steps will be 
    developed further into sub-steps, and you'll eventually implement a program based 
    on these ideas and sub-steps. There are two parts to an implementation: a 
    compression program and an uncompression/decompression program. You need both 
    to have a useful compression utility. We'll assume these are separate programs,

  uncompressed text file should of course match the original text file character for
   charcter Assuming you can write a specific number of bits at a time to a file, a
    compressed file is made using the following top-level steps. These steps will be 
    developed further into sub-steps, and you'll eventually implement a program based 
    on these ideas and sub-steps. There are two parts to an implementation: a 
    compression program and an uncompression/decompression program. You need both 
    to have a useful compression utility. We'll assume these are separate programs,
     but they share many classes, functions, modules, code or whatever unit-of-
     programming you're using. We'll call the program that reads a regular file and 
     produces a compressed file the compression or huffing program. The program that 
     does the reverse, producing a regular file from a compressed file, will be called t
     he uncompression or unhuffing program.

the Huffman coding algorithm found in the explanation. The compressed text will be

    The minimal trees have weights of three and four, these are joined into a tree

The minimal trees have weights of three and four, these are joined into a tree whose weight 
is seven leaving two trees. 
We'll assume that each character has an associated weight equal to the number of times
 the character occurs in a file. In the "go go gophers" example, the characters 'g' and
  'o' have weight 3, the space has weight 2, and the other characters have weight 1.
   When compressing a file we'll need to calculate these weights, we'll ignore this
    step for now and assume that all character weights have been calculated. Huffman's
     algorithm assumes that we're building a single tree from a group (or forest) of 
     trees. Initially, all the trees have a single node with a character and the character's
      weight. Trees are combined by picking two trees, and making a new tree from the 
      two trees. This decreases the number of trees by one at each step since two trees
       are combined into one tree. The algorithm is as follows:
