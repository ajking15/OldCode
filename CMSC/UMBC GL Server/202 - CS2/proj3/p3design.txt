Project 3 Design Questions

Copy this file to your directory and edit it to answer the questions below.
These questions are worth 10% of the project grade.
Be sure to submit your answers before the project design due date listed in the project description.

1. Where will you store the cost of the gumballs and candy bars?  Explain why you 
made this decision.

Cash Register. Because one of the functions of the cash register is to do everything a normal cash register would do, ie, calculate change
I believed it would make sense for the register to store the prices of the candy to streamline the process.


2. This project does not use inheritance.  Should it?  If so, which classes should be in
the inheritance hierarchy?  If not, why not?

No, from what I see none of the classes are a specialized form of another class. Also, each class(aside from the gumball/candybar clones)
are distinct with separate roles.
