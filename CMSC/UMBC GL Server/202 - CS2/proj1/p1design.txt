Part of the design process for a procedural solution to a programming problem like Project 1 is to
"envision" the various logical parts of the problem that will eventually become functions (or "methods"
in OO-speak).  This "vision" may often take the form of diagram that shows the logical flow of the solution.

For Project 1, try to envision what your solution will eventually look like prior to writing code.
Your assignment is to list the names of the various methods you will write (including main) and a brief description
of each method's purpose.  Don't write method headers with parameter definitions, just names and brief desciptions.

main - calls other functions

getKeyword - obtains the keyword from the user 

getMessage - obtains the chosen message for encoding/decoding from the user

option - asks the user if encoding or decoding is desired

removeWhitespace - takes the keyword/message and removes all whitespace

removeDuplicate - takes the keyword and removes duplicate letters 

initializeArray - takes the keyword and initializes the 5x5 array for encoding/decoding

encode - encodes the message given by the user using the playfair cipher

decode - decodes an ecrypted message using the playfair cipher
