   Last semester I coded a project in cmsc 491 that made use of socket
    programming, as such, I had already spent a fair bit of time looking over
    beej's guide. Due to my familiarty with socket programming I didn't have 
    a lot of trouble with this project. Overall, I found it to be a fairly
    enjoyable project to work on. The sample code given to us was very helpful
    in terms of getting started.
