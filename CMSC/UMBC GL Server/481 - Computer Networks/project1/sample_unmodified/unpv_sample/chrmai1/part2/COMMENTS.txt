   Similar to the other comments.txt, I've already done socket programming
    before. The new thing for me in this project was communicating with an 
    externel server. I ran in too several careless mistakes such as trying to
    recieve into a char pointer instead of an array, and, sending with sizeof
    instead of strlen. Both of which were errors easily enough avoided if I had
    read more carefully, although they were difficult to debug. It was fairly
    interesting reading through the rfc protocol. Overall I enjoyed the
    project. On another note, I finished the project over 4 days. I feel that
    the project timeline was much longer than it needs to be. On the other hand
    coding isn't a focus in this class so I'm not sure it matters.
