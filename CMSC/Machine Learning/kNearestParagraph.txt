Which value of k gave the best performance on the test data? 
I used 3 values of k for my data sets. For a k-value of 5 I managed 100% accuracy
on both the training and the test data.
For k-values of 1 and 3 I received marginally lower results with 49/50.
From the data I have it would appear that higher k-values
yield better results.
Is it possible given the procedure outlined above to have overfit the data in selecting k? 
Why or why not? 
Yes, overfitting is certainly possible. Especially at lower values of k as it 
will stick more rigidly to the data points.
